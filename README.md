# Smoking Status Prediction Using Machine Learning
## Overview
This project uses machine learning techniques to predict an individual's smoking status based on physiological and bio-signal data. The pipeline includes data analysis, feature engineering, and the implementation of ensemble methods for classification.
## Repository Structure
The repository contains three main Jupyter notebooks:
1. Exploratory Analysis Notebook
    - Performs initial data exploration, including univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analyses.
    - Visualizes feature distributions and relationships with smoking status.
2. Explanatory Analysis Notebook
    - Summarizes key insights from the exploratory analysis.
    - Highlights relevant relationships and prepares the dataset for modeling.
3. Models Training and Ensemble Notebook
    - Preprocesses the data and builds machine learning models.
    - Implements Bagging, Random Forest, and AdaBoost ensemble methods.
    - Tunes hyperparameters and evaluates model performance.
